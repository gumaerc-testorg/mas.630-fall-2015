Finally: Due Session 12, your final report (in PubPub or a .docx or .tex and .pdf of 4-7 pages)

Aim for no more than 4 pages if you're a soloist and no more than 7 if you're on a project team. If not using {{% resource_link "ba904467-19a8-47b7-af02-a68fbe55b9d5" "PubPub" %}}, then use a format for a conference of your choosing. For example, you could use the format for the Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction Conference, which uses the {{% resource_link "200227b8-39fc-4627-b0a3-9a7c9ec369cb" "IEEE Computer Society Formatting" %}}.
